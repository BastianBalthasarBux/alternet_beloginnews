# BElogin News: import RSS feeds into sys_news

This extension imports an RSS feed into the sys_news table of TYPO3,
which makes that news actually appear on the login-page of TYPO3 backend.

## History

The extension was first developed by alternet / Jigal van Hemert. #T3KUDOS to you!
The extension key has been handed over to Riccabona eSolutions, https://www.Riccabona.IT/ on 18th November 2019,
after further development was stalled by the original authors due to different reasons.

## Basic Configuration

Install the extension via Installtool (composer version is in the planning), and see the extensions configuration in the extension manager
or in the section "extension configuration" of TYPO3 v9.5 and up.

## Add task to TYPO3 scheduler

For making the import working, just add a new task in TYPO3-scheduler and run it e.g. once a day.



Have a lot of fun!
